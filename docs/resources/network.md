Network provider for ZeroTier, allows you to create ZeroTier networks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "zerotier_network" "my_network" {
  name        = "<required>"
  description = "Managed by Terraform"

  assign_ipv4 = {
    zerotier = true
  }

  assign_ipv6 = {
    zerotier = true
    sixplane = false
    rfc4193  = false
  }

  enable_broadcast = true
  private          = false
  flow_rules       = "accept;"

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The name of the network

### Optional

- **assign_ipv4** (Map of Boolean) IPv4 Assignment RuleSets
- **assign_ipv6** (Map of Boolean) IPv6 Assignment RuleSets
- **assignment_pool** (Block Set) Rules regarding IPv4 and IPv6 assignments (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--assignment_pool))
- **description** (String) The description of the network
- **enable_broadcast** (Boolean) Enable broadcast packets on the network
- **flow_rules** (String) The layer 2 flow rules to apply to packets traveling across this network. Please see https://www.zerotier.com/manual/#3_4_1 for more information.
- **mtu** (Number) MTU to set on the client virtual network adapter
